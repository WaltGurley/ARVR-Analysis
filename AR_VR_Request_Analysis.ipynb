I have two current students who are interested in helping to explore using the glasses within the context of the public speaking assignments. We would like to evaluate the glasses for use as a speaking aid, similar to notecards or a teleprompter. We plan to have each of the students give two versions of a speech, one with glasses, and one without glasses, to determine whether the glasses will improve their performance based on our standard rubric. We are particularly interested in determining whether the glasses will help improve physical and vocal delivery components such as eye contact and verbal pauses. Through this experience, we hope to develop a better understanding for how wearable technology such as Google Glasses might affect the future of public speaking. We are planning to write and produce a multi-modal exploration of this augmentation technology in the classroom, with the aim of publishing it in an online multi-modal journal such as Kairos.</td>\n",

I study fish biomechanics and have to do a great deal of filming and photography of live fish (creek chub and blacknose dace) in the field and in the lab, where hands-free voice commands would be a great advantage, not to mention the ability to have Glass assess changing lighting and motion conditions and take the best possible photo of a specimen using something like its Moment Camera app. As part of this project I also do water monitoring and hydrology, and I am interested in how Glass could be used for displaying live stream conditions and GIS data at field sites. For the pickup date requested (March 26th), I would only need two to three hours to try out Glass, and I would not need to remove it from the library. I hope this allows other library patrons to be accommodated as well. Apart from my immediate dissertation needs, I am very interested in assessing the applications Glass has for improving education. I am preparing for a university teaching career, so I am especially excited about the Glassentation app for use in giving talks and lectures. I would be interested in one day conducting pedagogy research to see whether this type of app increases student attention and learning by reducing the amount of time the instructor spends with his/her head down looking at lecture notes. The potential for Glass to help instructors keep track of student names (with face recognition software), receive questions during class from students who feel uncomfortable raising their hands (with messaging apps), and even to improve study abroad experiences (through on-demand translating), are to me all very exciting. Having the opportunity to use Glass would also improve the competitiveness of my teaching portfolio as I apply for jobs.Thank you for considering my request for the chance to use Google Glass on March 26th. Please feel free to contact me with any questions.</td>\n",

THATCamp is an opportunity for faculty, grad students, university staff and members of the public to learn and play at the intersections of technology, humanities, social sciences, arts, and libraries. Participants are welcomed to propose sessions that relate to digital scholarship and pedagogy or any other topic they'd like to explore with fellow attendees. Sessions typically enable participants to develop new skill sets, think through ideas in a cooperative setting, and workshop current and future projects. Attendees will include NCSU faculty and graduate students in Computer Science, History, English, Design and Communication, along with several fabulous librarians. Other participants will be traveling from Duke, UNC Chapel Hill, UNC Greensboro, Davidson, and even the University of Texas.  The common thread is a mutual interest in learning and making with technology. At least three of our attendees already know how to use Google Glass, and the idea is for one or more of them to offer an informal presentation on how the Glass could potentially be incorporated into attendees' current and future research and pedagogy. We are also inviting everyone who has checked out the Glass so far to share their experiences and plans.THATCamp will draw on the Hunt Library's high-tech spaces including the Teaching and Visualization Lab, the Game Lab, and the Creativity Studio. THATCamp staff and library staff (including Josh Boyer, Brendan O'Connell, Jeff Essic, and Adam Rogers) will be on hand to assist. In addition to sessions that participants propose in advance or on the spot, THATCamp will offer hands-on workshops led by librarians and faculty on the Arduino microprocessor, as part of NC State's parallel celebration of the worldwide Arduino Day 2014.  Other sessions will focus on topics ranging from data visualization and GIS to multiplayer interactive fiction.  With your help, we hope to feature Google Glass as well.</td>\n",

My primary focus when I continue my studies in graduate school will be to develop a system utilizing this research. If wearables similar to google glass are predicted to be a popular medium in the future I'd like to begin the development stage with those technologies in mind. With that being the case, having an idea of what a google glass user experience is like will propel how I design this system for similar wearable devices.  \n",

I have two current students who are interested in helping to explore using the glasses within the context of the public speaking assignments. We would like to evaluate the glasses for use as a speaking aid, similar to notecards or a teleprompter. We plan to have each of the students give two versions of a speech, one with glasses, and one without glasses, to determine whether the glasses will improve their performance based on our standard rubric. We are particularly interested in determining whether the glasses will help improve physical and vocal delivery components such as eye contact and verbal pauses. Through this experience, we hope to develop a better understanding for how wearable technology such as Google Glasses might affect the future of public speaking. We are planning to write and produce a multi-modal exploration of this augmentation technology in the classroom, with the aim of publishing it in an online multi-modal journal such as Kairos.  \n",

       "7                                                                                                                                                           I am interested in exploring how Glass can enhance my dissertation work. I study fish biomechanics and have to do a great deal of filming and photography of live fish (creek chub and blacknose dace) in the field and in the lab, where hands-free voice commands would be a great advantage, not to mention the ability to have Glass assess changing lighting and motion conditions and take the best possible photo of a specimen using something like its Moment Camera app. As part of this project I also do water monitoring and hydrology, and I am interested in how Glass could be used for displaying live stream conditions and GIS data at field sites. For the pickup date requested (March 26th), I would only need two to three hours to try out Glass, and I would not need to remove it from the library. I hope this allows other library patrons to be accommodated as well. Apart from my immediate dissertation needs, I am very interested in assessing the applications Glass has for improving education. I am preparing for a university teaching career, so I am especially excited about the Glassentation app for use in giving talks and lectures. I would be interested in one day conducting pedagogy research to see whether this type of app increases student attention and learning by reducing the amount of time the instructor spends with his/her head down looking at lecture notes. The potential for Glass to help instructors keep track of student names (with face recognition software), receive questions during class from students who feel uncomfortable raising their hands (with messaging apps), and even to improve study abroad experiences (through on-demand translating), are to me all very exciting. Having the opportunity to use Glass would also improve the competitiveness of my teaching portfolio as I apply for jobs.Thank you for considering my request for the chance to use Google Glass on March 26th. Please feel free to contact me with any questions.  \n",

       "9    I would like to incorporate the Glass into  THATCamp Digital Knowledge, a free, informal \"unconference\" that will take place at NCSU Hunt library on Friday, March 28. THATCamp is an opportunity for faculty, grad students, university staff and members of the public to learn and play at the intersections of technology, humanities, social sciences, arts, and libraries. Participants are welcomed to propose sessions that relate to digital scholarship and pedagogy or any other topic they'd like to explore with fellow attendees. Sessions typically enable participants to develop new skill sets, think through ideas in a cooperative setting, and workshop current and future projects. Attendees will include NCSU faculty and graduate students in Computer Science, History, English, Design and Communication, along with several fabulous librarians. Other participants will be traveling from Duke, UNC Chapel Hill, UNC Greensboro, Davidson, and even the University of Texas.  The common thread is a mutual interest in learning and making with technology. At least three of our attendees already know how to use Google Glass, and the idea is for one or more of them to offer an informal presentation on how the Glass could potentially be incorporated into attendees' current and future research and pedagogy. We are also inviting everyone who has checked out the Glass so far to share their experiences and plans.THATCamp will draw on the Hunt Library's high-tech spaces including the Teaching and Visualization Lab, the Game Lab, and the Creativity Studio. THATCamp staff and library staff (including Josh Boyer, Brendan O'Connell, Jeff Essic, and Adam Rogers) will be on hand to assist. In addition to sessions that participants propose in advance or on the spot, THATCamp will offer hands-on workshops led by librarians and faculty on the Arduino microprocessor, as part of NC State's parallel celebration of the worldwide Arduino Day 2014.  Other sessions will focus on topics ranging from data visualization and GIS to multiplayer interactive fiction.  With your help, we hope to feature Google Glass as well.  \n",

My current research work is based on future Internet-of-things (IOT) that too specifically on energy-efficiency. I know that Google Glass has an interface to output energy consumption values while it is being used. I need to measure them to extend my research work.

Over the last 2 years we have released 6 versions of a new mobility product.  In addition to regular CRM tasks, mobility has two features that would be interesting to test on Google Glass.  One is nearby contacts where we map contacts near your location.  Also, Business Card Scanner (BCS) which is in Beta.  BCS gives a professional the opportunity to take a photo of a business card for InterAction to OCR and begin to create a new contact.  During the week of testing, I will work heavily around these features among several others.  After that, I plan to have an article written that we can post to our LinkedIn, Twitter, Websites, etc.  These sites are all heavily visited, globally.  The article will also discuss our new relationship with NC State and the Hunt Library and how we were able to do these tests and obtain Glass.  You may have seen we are the sponsors of the Raleigh Half Ironman.  Basically, it is very important for LexisNexis to begin establishing itself in this community.  Thanks in advanced for your consideration. Scott  \n",

I am interested in using the technology to develop new methods of interacting within a digital space.  An example use could be the overlaying assembly instructions within a 3D space, which, would help with visualization of the final product, and assembly of the given product.  \n",

As well as ability to process live music and provide song information and lyrics of live shows.  \n",

Other dates/times may be workable but please email me with any additional questions/info. Thanks.  \n",

Following are a few examples of a hypothetical project brief for this assignment.\\r\\rBased on the affordances of the Glass platform:\\r\"Design an application for Glass that helps me converse with someone whose language I cannot speak\"\\r\"Design an application for Glass that allows the hearing impaired to participate in an experience that is aural/audio-dominate\"\\r\"Design an application for Glass that would help middle school students have a more engaging experience at the NC Science Museum\"\\rand so on...\\r\\rThis assignment has a focus on User Experience Design, and in order for students to understand how Glass works and to design realistic proof-of-concept prototypes, I would like to bring the equipment to class for them to try out for themselves. Our class meets MW from 1:30 to 5:45PM.\\r\\rThank you for your consideration.The check-out time period of Aug 27 to Sep 3 would give students two full class sessions to try out Glass, however, if it would help our chances, I can also bring the equipment back earlier than Sep 3.  \n",

I will try to be as specific as possible. 1) My sister and my uncle are doing research on Effect of Google glass on person with lense prescription for eyes. But as Google glass are very costly, they can't afford it. They both are planning to come  Raleigh, on my graduation 17th dec & 18th dec, 2014. So I believe they will get chance to do some experiments on me ( As I have glass prescription). 2) I want to capture my convocation ceremony with Google glasss.

John suggested this process for requesting access to the google glass. I put a request in earlier for the same but have not heard back regarding the availability for the same. I would be needing the glass for a project where I am working on Image correlation in real time using the Lukas-Kanade method for image correlation.

We would like to use Google Glass to help create 3 PSAs about environmental issues for a competition that could could provide funding to make NC State a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable university. By using this technology, we have a better chance at being able better the entire campus community.This would be a really great opportunity to apply this new technology.

Students will use these instead of notecards to present the speech and advance slides that have been prepared using the YourShow software that's been developed. I ran a small pilot of this last semester and hoping to expand it to more students this semester as a way of exploring the effects of such wearable technology on both speaker performance and audience perceptions.Is it possible to have these for the week of February 25th? I checked at the very beginning of the semester, and that week wasn't available yet, so I was checking back now in hopes of booking it. I have just a little bit of flexibility built into when I can schedule speaking days.  \n",

It's a piece of inspiration for those who are overly self-aware almost to the point of dissociation. Im a comedy writer, and Glass provides a new medium for expressive satire.  Also, Glass is pretty cool.  \n",

I would like to be ahead of the game since I am graduating May 2015.  Things I will do are record class lectures, record video presentations, and experiment with daily interactions with the Glass.\\r\\rThanks,\\rTrong Vu  \n",

This project is for our business school project as well as our purpose in our professional career. Google Glass has many special design for users that will be of great studies for this head device with the sleeping pod project.

For example, I have to watch ted talks for a class and it would be beneficial for me to one, be able to watch a ted talk while I write. Secondly, I think this will be beneficial for me to utilize while I work on my French studies. The ability to look up verbs, certain words and even grammatical concepts would be great.Although it may not matter I am someone that is interested in acquiring this product in the future and I see this as a great way for me to see if I would truly be able to utilize the product effectively or enough to justify purchasing it.  \n",

Specifically, language challenges are often faced in diverse classrooms.  Research has shown that many students understand concepts but don't know how to use the proper vocabulary to describe these concepts, particularly in science and math.  Google Glass has the potential to overcome some of these challenges in new, innovative ways repurposing existing apps for the classroom.  As a proof-of-principle experiment, four different apps available for Google Glass will be used:\\r1) Captioning on Glass, an application used to translate audio into transcription;\\r2) Word Lens, an application that can translate written words into other languages automatically;\\r3) Free Dictionary, an application that can define a wide variety of words in several languages and has a specific medical and science dictionary and\\r4) Signglasses, an application that can overlay sign language into live or video presentations and has a feature which allows for words to be defined just by looking at them with your Google Glasses.\\rTogether, these apps have the potential to increase student literacy in the classroom.  This test would assess the feasibility of a research study around these items.I am in Science Education and this study is related to my possible dissertation topic or to my minor exam study.  \n",

I do a lot of CAD data and 3D modelling ever since the oculus Rift came out i wanted to try it for using CAD modelling see how it can simplify the process. Currently I am interning in the triangle area and wanted to see if I can use it along with simulation software like Simio .  \n",

I am a Resident Advisor within Metcalf's Engineering Village. I would like to showcase the Oculus Rift to these Engineering students so they can experience 3-d virtual reality first hand. I also want to hold a group-conversation with the engineers and have them discuss with each other about the future of the virtual reality and have them share how they could utilize it in their future career paths, or even currently. If there are any staff or faculty that are involved or passionate about virtual reality, I would love to have their contact information and talk with them about possibly sharing/presenting at the program.

I develop programming for the Creative Media Photography Workshops and want to create more high tech opportunities for the activities we sponsor. Specifically with the Oculus Rift, I am interested in exploring the potential for application and use with images captured by NCSU Libraries' Photowalk participants.\\r\\rNOTE: I am also open to/would actually prefer a reservation date for much later during the Fall 2015 Semester to borrow and explore the Oculus Rift.  \n",
