NCSU Status,UseUndergraduate Student,Recreational use with PC.Undergraduate Student,I am using Oculus Rift as a trial run to see if it is worth saving money to buy one next year.Masters Student,Trying out this new technologyUndergraduate Student,Learning and researching possible uses for virtual travelUndergraduate Student,I would like to experience and test Development environments with the Oculus. More specifically for Unity3d and Unreal Engine 4 because of their support for Virtual Reality.Undergraduate Student,I wish to see a virtual world and determine the difference in immersion versus a screen. I also would like to see if it gives some kind of motion sickness as I have heard it could cause. I will write up a short report on it (like a blog post) for the internet as well. Re-request (couldn't make pick up date). Copied above from previous request.Undergraduate Student,To expierience it. I will soon be developing programs for it.Undergraduate Student,Researching how to incorporate the oculus rift in Unity and UE4 in an effort to create our own experience and allow us to create a website involving the device.Undergraduate Student,"I'm a senior in Marketing and would like to demo this product to learn more about the Oculus' place in current technology, for future research that I am doing."Undergraduate Student,"Independent learning and experimentation with programming VR apps, using Unreal Engine 4.7 primarily (I have full access via Github-Student), and secondarily with Unity 5 and Blender. ""As a student who intends on majoring in CSC, and with a serious interest in VR as well as the UDK (Unreal Development Kit), having the opportunity to use a DK1 would be both fun and educational.As for pick-up times, I obviously prioritize classes, and as I have a lab from 2-4, any time around or after 4:30 would be preferred."Masters Student,Recreation purposes - just want to try out the technology. Please feel free to priortize others!Masters Student,I am studying Manufacturing System . I do a lot of CAD data and 3D modelling ever since the oculus Rift came out i wanted to try it for using CAD modelling see how it can simplify the process. Currently I am interning in the triangle area and wanted to see if I can use it along with simulation software like Simio .Masters Student,I'm a professional software developer and an incoming MBA. I am interested in exploring/learning about this technology and would like to build software on this platform.Undergraduate Student,Writing a class term paper on virtual reality technologyUndergraduate Student,"Hello, I am going to use the Oculus Rift to inspire Engineering students interested in gaming and 3-d virtual reality. I am a Resident Advisor within Metcalf's Engineering Village. I would like to showcase the Oculus Rift to these Engineering students so they can experience 3-d virtual reality first hand. I also want to hold a group-conversation with the engineers and have them discuss with each other about the future of the virtual reality and have them share how they could utilize it in their future career paths, or even currently. If there are any staff or faculty that are involved or passionate about virtual reality, I would love to have their contact information and talk with them about possibly sharing/presenting at the program. Thanks~"Other,"I am using the Oculus Rift for learning purposes, as I am interested in going into software design later, and would like to see how the Rift funcrions."Masters Student,Learning and researchMasters Student,"I would like to test the potential of the Oculus Rift for a teaching environment, i.e. using VR for teaching new concepts to students. I actually booked the Oculus Rift when it was listed as a book but turned out it was listed incorrectly when I came to get it a week later. Hopefully I could get a shot at it again. Fingers crossed!"Masters Student,"Modelling, rendering 3D mechanical systems and game designing; product visualization and development"Masters Student,I would like get introduced to the technology.Masters Student,Playing sessionUndergraduate Student,Testing to see if how well a person who is blind in one eye and has the use of their other eye is able to use the technology. Other aspects pertaining to the technology's usefulness to the physically disabled will be investigated.Staff,"Recently, I had a very exciting experience at Duke Univ.'s DiVE with immersive Virtual Reality. I develop programming for the Creative Media Photography Workshops and want to create more high tech opportunities for the activities we sponsor. Specifically with the Oculus Rift, I am interested in exploring the potential for application and use with images captured by NCSU Libraries' Photowalk participants.NOTE: I am also open to/would actually prefer a reservation date for much later during the Fall 2015 Semester to borrow and explore the Oculus Rift."Undergraduate Student,Personal project involving using the Oculus to test stereoscopic vision on a robot.Staff,Research and testing for 360 spherical video production and virtual reality applications for online education. Happy to provide demo content (video) if needed.Undergraduate Student,Use to learn about how this technology could effect popular culture in the future.Undergraduate Student,I will be using the Oculus Rift for gaming purposes. This is a great opportunity to try out advanced technology and I would be excited to try it out.Masters Student,to explore 3d capabilities and also get the immersion experience.Masters Student,I am trying to propose an idea fro robotic education for children using the Oculus rift machine. Many modules have already been created for children below 13 years. This will mainly be used for research purpose.Undergraduate Student,"I am interested in website design, and I would like to learn how using a wearable browsing device changes use patterns, and how to develop for wearable VR technology. I also like games very much, and think it would be super cool to experience the difference in gaming experience."Undergraduate Student,Robotics ProjectUndergraduate Student,Learning about the SDK and it's possible applications for both gaming and educational purposes.Undergraduate Student,Me and some friends want to try out the Oculus Rift since we are planing in getting together and purchasing one.Masters Student,I am going to use Oculus Rift for academic and research purpose.
