NCSU Status,UseUndergraduate Student,I am going to use Glass on a platform my brother and I are building called Citywix.com. It is currently a class project as well as a startup project for students within the Entrepreneurship Initiative program as well as the Entrepreneurship concentration within PCOM.Undergraduate Student,"I am studying the possibilities of combining creative coding with big data to explore the possibilities of digital media experiences and distribution. My primary focus when I continue my studies in graduate school will be to develop a system utilizing this research. If wearables similar to google glass are predicted to be a popular medium in the future I'd like to begin the development stage with those technologies in mind. With that being the case, having an idea of what a google glass user experience is like will propel how I design this system for similar wearable devices."Undergraduate Student,Learning about the possible ways to implement its use with a web server.Masters Student,"Application Development: Specifically, building basic Facebook integration for Glass so as to quantify the implecations of wearable devices on social media."Undergraduate Student,Research and development.PhD Student,"I plan to use the Google Glasses for teaching and learning in the COM 110 public speaking course that I teach. I have two current students who are interested in helping to explore using the glasses within the context of the public speaking assignments. We would like to evaluate the glasses for use as a speaking aid, similar to notecards or a teleprompter. We plan to have each of the students give two versions of a speech, one with glasses, and one without glasses, to determine whether the glasses will improve their performance based on our standard rubric. We are particularly interested in determining whether the glasses will help improve physical and vocal delivery components such as eye contact and verbal pauses. Through this experience, we hope to develop a better understanding for how wearable technology such as Google Glasses might affect the future of public speaking. We are planning to write and produce a multi-modal exploration of this augmentation technology in the classroom, with the aim of publishing it in an online multi-modal journal such as Kairos."Masters Student,I want to use Glass to get a feel of it and the development environment so that I can use this information as a reference point for a potential app.PhD Student,"I am interested in exploring how Glass can enhance my dissertation work. I study fish biomechanics and have to do a great deal of filming and photography of live fish (creek chub and blacknose dace) in the field and in the lab, where hands-free voice commands would be a great advantage, not to mention the ability to have Glass assess changing lighting and motion conditions and take the best possible photo of a specimen using something like its Moment Camera app. As part of this project I also do water monitoring and hydrology, and I am interested in how Glass could be used for displaying live stream conditions and GIS data at field sites. For the pickup date requested (March 26th), I would only need two to three hours to try out Glass, and I would not need to remove it from the library. I hope this allows other library patrons to be accommodated as well. Apart from my immediate dissertation needs, I am very interested in assessing the applications Glass has for improving education. I am preparing for a university teaching career, so I am especially excited about the Glassentation app for use in giving talks and lectures. I would be interested in one day conducting pedagogy research to see whether this type of app increases student attention and learning by reducing the amount of time the instructor spends with his/her head down looking at lecture notes. The potential for Glass to help instructors keep track of student names (with face recognition software), receive questions during class from students who feel uncomfortable raising their hands (with messaging apps), and even to improve study abroad experiences (through on-demand translating), are to me all very exciting. Having the opportunity to use Glass would also improve the competitiveness of my teaching portfolio as I apply for jobs.Thank you for considering my request for the chance to use Google Glass on March 26th. Please feel free to contact me with any questions."Masters Student,Researching learningPhD Student,"I would like to incorporate the Glass into  THATCamp Digital Knowledge, a free, informal ""unconference"" that will take place at NCSU Hunt library on Friday, March 28. THATCamp is an opportunity for faculty, grad students, university staff and members of the public to learn and play at the intersections of technology, humanities, social sciences, arts, and libraries. Participants are welcomed to propose sessions that relate to digital scholarship and pedagogy or any other topic they'd like to explore with fellow attendees. Sessions typically enable participants to develop new skill sets, think through ideas in a cooperative setting, and workshop current and future projects. Attendees will include NCSU faculty and graduate students in Computer Science, History, English, Design and Communication, along with several fabulous librarians. Other participants will be traveling from Duke, UNC Chapel Hill, UNC Greensboro, Davidson, and even the University of Texas.  The common thread is a mutual interest in learning and making with technology. At least three of our attendees already know how to use Google Glass, and the idea is for one or more of them to offer an informal presentation on how the Glass could potentially be incorporated into attendees' current and future research and pedagogy. We are also inviting everyone who has checked out the Glass so far to share their experiences and plans.THATCamp will draw on the Hunt Library's high-tech spaces including the Teaching and Visualization Lab, the Game Lab, and the Creativity Studio. THATCamp staff and library staff (including Josh Boyer, Brendan O'Connell, Jeff Essic, and Adam Rogers) will be on hand to assist. In addition to sessions that participants propose in advance or on the spot, THATCamp will offer hands-on workshops led by librarians and faculty on the Arduino microprocessor, as part of NC State's parallel celebration of the worldwide Arduino Day 2014.  Other sessions will focus on topics ranging from data visualization and GIS to multiplayer interactive fiction.

Over the last 2 years we have released 6 versions of a new mobility product.  In addition to regular CRM tasks, mobility has two features that would be interesting to test on Google Glass.  One is nearby contacts where we map contacts near your location.  Also, Business Card Scanner (BCS) which is in Beta.  BCS gives a professional the opportunity to take a photo of a business card for InterAction to OCR and begin to create a new contact.  During the week of testing, I will work heavily around these features among several others.  After that, I plan to have an article written that we can post to our LinkedIn, Twitter, Websites, etc.  These sites are all heavily visited, globally.  The article will also discuss our new relationship with NC State and the Hunt Library and how we were able to do these tests and obtain Glass.
